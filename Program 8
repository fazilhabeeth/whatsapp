Ex 8: Implement And Demonstrate The Find-S Algorithm For Finding Trhe Most 

Specific Hypothesis Based On A Given Set Of Training Data Samples. Read The 

Training Data From A Csv File

SOURCE CODE :

#Import csv file

import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

#to read the data in the csv file

data = pd.read_csv("S:\DL lab\8thdata.csv")

print(data,"n")

#making an array of all the attributes

d = np.array(data)[:,:-1]

print("\n The attributes are: ",d)

#segragating the target that has positive and negative examples

target = np.array(data)[:,-1]

print("\n The target is: ",target)

#training function to implement find-s algorithm

 else: 

pass

 

 return specific_hypothesis

#obtaining the final hypothesis

print("\n The final hypothesis is:",train(d,target))
