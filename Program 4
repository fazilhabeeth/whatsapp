Ex 4: Implement Linear Regression Using Python

SOURCE CODE :

#Import csv file

import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# To read data from Age_Income.csv file

dataFrame = pd.read_csv('S:\Book1.csv')

# To place data in to age and income vectors

age = dataFrame['AGE']

income = dataFrame['SALARY']

# number of points

num = np.size(age)

# To find the mean of age and income vector

mean_age = np.mean(age)

mean_income = np.mean(income)

# calculating cross-deviation and deviation about age

CD_ageincome = np.sum(income*age) - num*mean_income*mean_age

CD_ageage = np.sum(age*age) - num*mean_age*mean_age

# calculating regression coefficients

b1 = CD_ageincome / CD_ageage

b0 = mean_income - b1*mean_age

# to display coefficients

print("Estimated Coefficients :")

print("b0 = ",b0,"\nb1 = ",b1)

# To plot the actual points as scatter plot

plt.scatter(age, income, color = "b",marker = "o")

# TO predict response vector

response_Vec = b0 + b1*age

# To plot the regression line

plt.plot(age, response_Vec, color = "r")
# Placing labels

plt.xlabel('Age')

plt.ylabel('Income')

# To display plot

plt.show()
